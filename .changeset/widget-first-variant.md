Flip `<zitadel-login>` to widget-first: the default `variant="widget"` is content-sized, transparent through every layer, injects no default font into the host document, and never steals focus on load — the embedding app owns the page. Dedicated login routes (hosted shell, scaffolded pages) opt into the previous full-page behavior with `variant="page"`. Split-family responsive chrome now keys off the widget's own width via container queries (baseline 2023 browsers), the hero design ships neutral placeholder copy instead of fabricated claims, and split tenants with only a `hero_url` keep a compact banner fallback on narrow widths.
