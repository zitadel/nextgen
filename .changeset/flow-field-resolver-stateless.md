Credentials are no longer modeled as user-schema properties — flow definitions reference them through `x-auth-methods` instead. A password field in a flow step is now `"x-auth-methods#password"`, sourced from the schema's `x-auth-methods` keyword, rather than a `password` user property carrying `x-password: true`.
