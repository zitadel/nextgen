/**
 * `@storybook/addon-vitest` transforms the stories into Vitest tests and runs
 * them in real Chromium (Playwright). Each story gets a render smoke test, its
 * `play` function (interaction), and the `a11y: { test: "error" }` checks from
 * `.storybook/preview.ts`. This is the parity/behaviour gate that replaced the
 * old `console-e2e` visual sweep, and it runs in CI via `moon ci :test`.
 *
 * Orchestrator stories are tagged `no-test` (they drive real network + the MSW
 * worker; their behaviour is covered by the `@zitadel/components` specs).
